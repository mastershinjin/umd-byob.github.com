Several variants of the pipeline have since been published, but the major steps remain unchanged.  In this first session, I will explain each step of the OrthoMCL pipeline in detail.",

        "abstract": "The primary differences between the various flavors of the OrthoMCL pipeline are the metrics used to weight the graph and/or MCL inflation parameter value(s).  The effects of these differences can be very difficult to understand and the corresponding publications provide very little, if any, helpful information.  I have therefore systematically explored the effects of these parameters on clustering a subset of sequences from the euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) database, simulating the fragmentation that commonly results from modern high-throughput sequencing projects.",
